# Mini Twitter API

This is the complete solution for the code challenge related to the recruiting process for HSBC. 

## Requirements

For the code challenge details and requirements please refer [Challenge details](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md)

## Description

This project provides the solution for building a simple social networking application, similar to Twitter, which is
exposed through a web API. The application supports the scenarios listed below.

## Scenarios

### Posting

A user should be able to post a 140 character message.

### Wall

A user should be able to see a list of the messages they've posted, in reverse
chronological order.

### Following

A user should be able to follow another user. Following doesn't have to be
reciprocal: Alice can follow Bob without Bob having to follow Alice.

### Timeline

A user should be able to see a list of the messages posted by all the people
they follow, in reverse chronological order.

## Details

- use JAVA
- provide some documentation for the API, so that we know how to use it!
- don't care about registering users: a user is created as soon as they post
  their first message
- don't care about user authentication
- don't care about frontend, only backend
- don't care about storage: storing everything in memory is fine
